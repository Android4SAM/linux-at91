Introduction
=============

UBIFS file-system stands for UBI File System. UBI stands for "Unsorted
Block Images". UBIFS is a flash file system, which means it is designed
to work with flash devices. It is important to understand, that UBIFS
is completely different to any traditional file-system in Linux, like
Ext2, XFS, JFS, etc. UBIFS represents a separate class of file-systems
which work with MTD devices, not block devices. The other Linux
file-system of this class is JFFS2.

To make it more clear, here is a small comparison of MTD devices and
block devices.

1 MTD devices represent flash device and they consist of eraseblocks of
  rather large size, typically about 128KiB. Block devices consist of
  small blocks, typically 512 bytes.
2 MTD devices support 3 main operations - read from some offset withing
  eraseblock, write to some offset within eraseblock, and erase whole
  eraseblock. Block  devices support 2 main operations - read whole
  block and write whole block.
3 Whole eraseblock has to be erased before it becomes possible to
  re-write its contents. Blocks may be just re-written.
4 Eraseblocks become worn out after some amount of erase cycles -
  typically 100K-1G for SLC NAND and NOR flashes, and 1K-10K for MLC
  NAND flashes. Blocks do not have the wear-out property.
5 Eraseblocks may become bad (only on NAND flashes) and software should
  deal with this. Blocks on hard drives typically do not become bad,
  because hardware has mechanisms to substitute bad blocks, at least in
  modern LBA disks.

I should be quite obvious why UBIFS is very different to traditional
file-systems.

UBIFS works on top of UBI. UBI is a separate software layer which may be
found in drivers/mtd/ubi. UBI is basically a volume management and
wear-leveling layer. It provides so called UBI volumes which is higher
level abstraction than MTD device. The programming model of UBI devices
is very similar to MTD devices - they still consist of large eraseblocks,
they have read/write/erase operations, but UBI devices are devoid of
some limitations wear and bad blocks (items 4 and 5 in the above list).

In a sense, UBIFS is a next generation of JFFS2 file-system, but it is
very different and incompatible to JFFS2. The following are the main
differences.

* JFFS2 works on top of MTD devices, UBIFS depends on UBI and works on
  top of UBI volumes.
* JFFS2 does not have on-media index and has to build it while mounting,
  which requires full media scan. UBIFS maintains the FS indexing
  information on the flash media and does not require full media scan,
  so it mounts many times faster than JFFS2.
* JFFS2 is a write-through file-system, while UBIFS supports write-back,
  which makes UBIFS much faster on writes.

Similarly to JFFS2, UBIFS supports on-the-flight compression which makes
it possible to fit quite a lot of data to the flash.

Similarly to JFFS2, UBIFS is tolerant to unclean reboots and power-cuts.
It does not need stuff like ckfs.ext2. UBIFS automatically replays its
journal and recovers form crashes, maintaining the on-flash data
structures consistent.

UBIFS scales logarithmically (most of the data structures it uses are
trees), so the mount time and memory consumption do not linearly depend
on the flash size, like in case of JFFS2. This is because UBIFS
maintains the FS index on the flash media. However, UBIFS depends on
UBI, which scales linearly. So overall UBI/UBIFS stack scales linearly.
Nevertheless, UBI/UBIFS scales considerably better than JFFS2.

The authors of UBIFS believe, that it is possible to develop UBI2 which
would scale logarithmically as well. UBI2 would be incompatible to UBI,
though. The nice side of this is that UBIFS would stay intact.


Mount options
=============

(*) == default.

norm_unmount (*)	commit on unmount; the journal is committed
			when the file-system is unmounted so that the
			next mount does not have to replay the journal
			and it becomes very fast;
fast_umount		do not commit on unmount; this option makes
			unmount faster, but the next mount slower
			because of the need to replay the journal.

Quick usage instructions
========================

The UBI volume to mount is specified using "ubiX_Y" or "ubiX:NAME" syntax,
where "X" is UBI device number, "Y" is UBI volume number, and "NAME" is
UBI volume name.

Mount volume 0 on UBI device 0 to /mnt/ubifs:
$ mount -t ubifs ubi0_0 /mnt/ubifs

Mount "rootfs" volume of UBI device 0 to /mnt/ubifs ("rootfs" is volume
name):
$ mount -t ubifs ubi0:rootfs /mnt/ubifs

The following is an example of the kernel boot arguments to attach mtd0
to UBI and mount volume "rootfs":
ubi.mtd=0 root=ubi0:rootfs rootfstype=ubifs
