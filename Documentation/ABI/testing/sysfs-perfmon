Description:	provide the configuration interface for the perfmon subsystems.
	        The tree contains information about the detected hardware,
		current state of the subsystem as well as some configuration
		parameters.

		The tree consists of the following entries:

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/debug (read-write):

		Enable perfmon debugging output. The traces are rate-limited
		to avoid flooding the console. It is possible to change the
		throttling via /proc/sys/kernel/printk_ratelimit.

		The value is interpreted as a bitmask.  Each bit enables a
		particular type of debug messages. Refer to the file
		include/linux/perfmon_kern.h for more information.

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/task_group (read-write):

		Users group allowed to create a per-thread context (session).
   		-1 means any group.

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/task_sessions_count (read-only):

		Number of per-thread contexts (sessions) currently attached
		to threads.

   	/sys/kernel/perfmon/version (read-only):

		Perfmon interface revision number.

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/arg_mem_max(read-write):

		Maximum size of vector arguments expressed in bytes.
		It can be modified but must be at least a page.
		Default: PAGE_SIZE
