Description
-----------

The F8000 is a Super I/O chip designed by Fintek for Asus, which includes
hardware monitoring capabilities. It can monitor 3 internal voltages, up to
4 fans and up to 3 temperature sensors.

This chip also has fan controlling features, which are not supported by
this driver (yet).

The driver assumes that no more than one chip is present, which seems
reasonable.


Voltage Monitoring
------------------

Voltages are sampled by an 8-bit ADC with a LSB of 8 mV. The supported
range is thus from 0 to 2.040 V. The F8000 only monitors its own voltages,
and they are all divided by 2 internally, so that they fit in this range.

This voltage input mapping is as follows:

in0     VCC3	+3.3V
in1     VSB	+3.3V Stand-By
in2     VBAT	battery


Fan Monitoring
--------------

Fan rotation speeds are reported as 12-bit values from a gated clock
signal. Speeds down to 366 RPM can be measured. There is no theoretical
high limit.

The chip and driver assume 2 pulse-per-revolution fans.


Temperature Monitoring
----------------------

Temperatures are reported in degrees Celsius. Each temperature measured
has a high limit and a critical limit. The driver doesn't yet support
changing these limits.

One of the temperature channels is internal, the other two are external.
The mapping is as follows:

temp1   internal
temp2   external
temp3   external


Fan Control
-----------

Not supported by the driver at this point.
