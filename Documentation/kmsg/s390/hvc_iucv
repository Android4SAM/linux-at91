 * Description:
 * On Linux instances that run in environments other than the z/VM hypervisor,
 * z/VM IUCV is not available and the z/VM IUCV Hypervisor console cannot be
 * used.
 * User action:
 * If the system does not run on a z/VM guest virtual machine,

 *   @1: Return code of the operation that has failed.
 * Description:
 * The driver initialization has failed to allocate a new z/VM IUCV HVC

 * Description:
 * The driver initialization has failed to register its z/VM IUCV callbacks to
