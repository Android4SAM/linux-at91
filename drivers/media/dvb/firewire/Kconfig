	  Support for DVB receivers from Digital Everywhere
	  which are connected via IEEE 1394 (FireWire).

	  These devices don't have an MPEG decoder built in,
	  so you need an external software decoder to watch TV.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here:
	  the module will be called firedtv.
