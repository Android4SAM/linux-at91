config MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME
	bool "Allow unsafe resume (DANGEROUS)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will assume that all cards
	  stayed in their respective slots during the suspend. The
	  normal behaviour is to remove them at suspend and
	  redetecting them at resume. Breaking this assumption will
	  in most cases result in data corruption.

	  This option is usually just for embedded systems which use
	  a MMC/SD card for rootfs. Most people should say N here.

config MMC_PASSWORDS
	boolean "MMC card lock/unlock passwords (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	select KEYS
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the use of passwords to lock and unlock
	  MMC cards.  This uses the access key retention support, using
	  request_key to look up the key associated with each card.

	  For example, if you have an MMC card that was locked using
	  Symbian OS on your cell phone, you won't be able to read it
	  on Linux without this support.
