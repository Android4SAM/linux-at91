# FIXME: SCSI_OSD_INITIATOR should select CONFIG (HMAC) SHA1 somehow.
#        How is it done properly?

config SCSI_OSD_INITIATOR
	tristate "OSD-Initiator library"
	depends on SCSI
	help
		Enable the OSD-Initiator library (libosd.ko).
		NOTE: You must also select CRYPTO_SHA1 + CRYPTO_HMAC and their
		dependencies

config SCSI_OSD_ULD
	tristate "OSD Upper Level driver"
	depends on SCSI_OSD_INITIATOR
	help
		Build a SCSI upper layer driver that exports /dev/osdX devices
		to user-mode for testing and controlling OSD devices. It is also
		needed by osdfs, for mounting an OSD based file system.

config SCSI_OSD_DEBUG
	bool "Compile All OSD modules with lots of DEBUG prints"
	default n
	depends on SCSI_OSD_INITIATOR
	help
		OSD Code is populated with lots of OSD_DEBUG(..) printouts to
		dmesg. Enable this if you found a bug and you want to help us
		track the problem (see also MAINTAINERS).
