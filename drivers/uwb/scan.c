 * FIXME: docs
 * FIXME: there are issues here on how BEACON and SCAN on USB RCI deal
 *        with each other. Currently seems that START_BEACON while
 *        SCAN_ONLY will cancel the scan, so we need to update the
 *        state here. Clarification request sent by email on
 *        10/05/2005.
 *        10/28/2005 No clear answer heard--maybe we'll hack the API
 *                   so that when we start beaconing, if the HC is
 *                   scanning in a mode not compatible with beaconing
 *                   we just fail.
