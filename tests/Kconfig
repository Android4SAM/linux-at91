	  Say Y here if you want the kernel to run a short self-test during
	  bootup. The self-test checks whether common types of locking bugs
	  are detected by debugging mechanisms or not. (if you disable
	  lock debugging then those bugs wont be detected of course.)
	  The following locking APIs are covered: spinlocks, rwlocks,
	  mutexes and rwsems.
