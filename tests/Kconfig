menuconfig KERNEL_TESTS

	help
	  You can build kernel subsystem specific tests.

	bool "Locking API boot-time self-tests"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the kernel to run a short self-test during
	  bootup. The self-test checks whether common types of locking bugs
	  are detected by debugging mechanisms or not. (if you disable
	  lock debugging then those bugs wont be detected of course.)
	  The following locking APIs are covered: spinlocks, rwlocks,
	  mutexes and rwsems.

config RCU_TORTURE_TEST
	tristate "torture tests for RCU"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	depends on m
	default n
	help
	  This option provides a kernel module that runs torture tests
	  on the RCU infrastructure.  The kernel module may be built
	  after the fact on the running kernel to be tested, if desired.

	  Say M if you want the RCU torture tests to build as a module.
	  Say N if you are unsure.
