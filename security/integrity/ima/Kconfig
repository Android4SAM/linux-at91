	  The Trusted Computing Group(TCG) runtime Integrity
	  Measurement Architecture(IMA) maintains a list of hash
	  values of executables and other sensitive system files
	  loaded into the run-time of this system.  If your system
	  has a TPM chip, then IMA also maintains an aggregate
	  integrity value over this list inside the TPM hardware.
	  These measurements and the aggregate (signed inside the
	  TPM) can be retrieved and presented to remote parties to
	  establish system properties. If unsure, say N.

	  IMA_MEASURE_PCR_IDX determines the TPM PCR register index
	  that IMA uses to maintain the integrity aggregate of the
	  measurement list.  If unsure, use the default 10.

config IMA_BASE_HOOKS
	bool "IMA base hooks"
	depends on IMA
	default n
	help
	  Enable this option to allow the LSM module to enforce integrity.
