/*
 * Basic general purpose allocator for managing special purpose
 * memory, for example, memory that is not managed by the regular
 * kmalloc/kfree interface.  Uses for this includes on-device special
 * memory, uncached memory etc.
 *
 * It is safe to use the allocator in NMI handlers and other special
 * unblockable contexts that could otherwise deadlock on locks.  This
 * is implemented by using atomic operations and retries on any
 * conflicts.  The disadvantage is that there may be livelocks in
 * extreme cases.  For better scalability, one allocator can be used
 * for each CPU.
 *
 * The lockless operation only works if there is enough memory
 * available.  If new memory is added to the pool a lock has to be
 * still taken.  So any user relying on locklessness has to ensure
 * that sufficient memory is preallocated.
 *
 * The basic atomic operation of this allocator is cmpxchg on long.
 * On architectures that don't have NMI-safe cmpxchg implementation,
 * the allocator can NOT be used in NMI handler.  So code uses the
 * allocator in NMI handler should depend on
 * CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_NMI_SAFE_CMPXCHG.
