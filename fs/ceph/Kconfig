config CEPH_FS
        tristate "Ceph distributed file system (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on INET && EXPERIMENTAL
	select LIBCRC32C
	select CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES
	help
	  Choose Y or M here to include support for mounting the
	  experimental Ceph distributed file system.  Ceph is an extremely
	  scalable file system designed to provide high performance,
	  reliable access to petabytes of storage.

	  More information at http://ceph.newdream.net/.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CEPH_FS_PRETTYDEBUG
	bool "Include file:line in ceph debug output"
	depends on CEPH_FS
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, debug output will include a filename and
	  line to aid debugging.  This icnreases kernel size and slows
	  execution slightly when debug call sites are enabled (e.g.,
	  via CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG).

	  If unsure, say N.

config CEPH_RBD
	bool "Rados block device (RBD)"
	depends on CEPH_FS
	select  CONFIG_BLOCK
	default y
	help
	  If you say Y here, ceph will include rbd, the RADOS block
	  device which stripes a block device over objects stored in
	  the Ceph distributed object store.
