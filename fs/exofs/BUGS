- Some mount time options should have been 64-bit, but are declared as 32-bit
  because that's what the kernel's parsing methods support at this time.

- Out-of-space may cause a severe problem if the object (and directory entry)
  were written, but the inode attributes failed. Then if the filesystem was
  unmounted and mounted the kernel can get into an endless loop doing a readdir.
